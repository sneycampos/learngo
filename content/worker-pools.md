# Worker Pools

Concurrent worker goroutines.

Worker pools use a fixed number of goroutines to process jobs concurrently.

## Example Code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Println("worker", id, "started job", j)
        time.Sleep(time.Second)
        fmt.Println("worker", id, "finished job", j)
        results <- j * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 5)
    results := make(chan int, 5)
    
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }
    
    for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)
    
    for a := 1; a <= 5; a++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

## Output

```
worker 1 started job 1
worker 2 started job 2
worker 3 started job 3
worker 1 finished job 1
worker 1 started job 4
worker 2 finished job 2
worker 2 started job 5
worker 3 finished job 3
worker 1 finished job 4
worker 2 finished job 5
```
